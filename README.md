Overview

This project focuses on the development of an autonomous driving system using AI/ML techniques. The model is trained to process input from sensors/cameras and make real-time driving decisions. The system includes modules for object detection, lane detection, and autonomous navigation.

Features

Lane Detection: Identifies lane boundaries using computer vision.

Object Detection: Recognizes vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.

Autonomous Navigation: Uses reinforcement learning and deep learning models.

Real-Time Processing: Optimized for quick decision-making.

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy & Pandas

Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, DQN)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the model:

python main.py

Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of road images, including real-world traffic scenarios. Preprocessed data is used for optimal performance.

Results

The model successfully detects lanes, avoids obstacles, and navigates autonomously. Further improvements can be made in accuracy and real-world adaptability.

Future Enhancements

Integration with ROS for real-world applications.

Deployment on embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano).

Improved decision-making using advanced reinforcement learning techniques.
